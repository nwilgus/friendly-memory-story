Oscar bounced his right leg nervously as he sat in the waitingn room of his
doctors office. There were old magazines on the end table, and the smell of
harsh cleaning chemicals filled his nostrils. He hated going to the doctor,
even if it was only for a routine visit.

As he waited, he jumped up and started pacing the waiting room growing more
and more anxious. The anticipation of the visit was almost worse than the 
visit itself. He sat back down and tried to focus on staying calm. "Oscar",
he suddenly heard from the other end of the waiting room, causing him to jump.
